Day-Night Transition Simulation — About
=======================================

Overview
- PyOpenGL mini-project that renders a continuous day–night cycle with smooth lighting transitions, moving clouds, stars, fireflies, shadows, and a stylized landscape (trees and a house).
- Time is user-controllable: start at any hour, jump to specific hours, or let simulated time advance automatically.

Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- PyOpenGL (OpenGL + GLUT/FreeGLUT bindings)
- OpenGL-capable GPU/driver; validated on Windows

Architecture and Flow
- Entry point (main.py): constructs the Application, prompts for starting hour (00–23), configures a GLUT window with 2D orthographic projection, and registers draw/idle/keyboard callbacks.
- Scene management (src/scene.py): owns entities, simulated clock, and render/update loop. It classifies time into day (06:00–18:00) vs night (18:00–06:00), maps hours to sun/moon angles along a shared elliptical arc, and advances time per frame.
- Render order: background gradient → ground → stars → clouds → trees/house with shadows → fireflies → moon/sun. After rendering, time advances unless paused.
- Lighting and transitions: background and ground colors interpolate by sun/moon angle; celestial brightness follows sin(angle)^1.5. TRANSITION_SPEED in scene.py controls fade pacing.
- Time model: DAY_START=06, DAY_END=18 (12h day); NIGHT_SPAN mirrors for 12h night. Manual jumps call Scene.set_hour() to reposition sun/moon and retint immediately.

Controls (window focused)
- H: print help to console
- Q: quit
- 00–23: type two digits to jump to that hour (auto-processed after 2 digits)

Configuration
- src/config.py: window size/position/title; color palettes (sky, ground, foliage, house day/night); counts (stars, fireflies, clouds); geometry (sun/moon radii/positions, tree/house positions); TIME_SCALE to speed or slow the full cycle.
- src/scene.py: TRANSITION_SPEED for day↔night fades.

Visual Components
- Background gradient: interpolated day/night palettes with angle-driven brightness.
- Sun/Moon: shared arc, glow halo, brightness tied to angle; visibility toggles with time of day.
- Stars: twinkle animation; night-only.
- Clouds: alpha-blended puffs drifting horizontally; day-only.
- Ground: grass rectangle with day/night color interpolation.
- House: day/night window color and brightness; blended shadow based on sun direction/height.
- Trees: layered conifers with day/night brightness; sun-driven shadows.
- Fireflies: bounded random walk; night-only.

How to Run
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
- Enter a starting hour (00–23) when prompted; keep the window focused for controls.

File Map
- main.py               : application bootstrap, input handling, GLUT setup
- src/config.py         : global constants and tuning knobs
- src/scene.py          : scene manager, timekeeping, render/update loop
- src/entities/         : drawable components
  - background.py       : sky gradient
  - celestial.py        : sun, moon, stars, clouds
  - ground.py           : ground/grass shading
  - house.py            : house geometry, windows, shadows
  - nature.py           : grass blades, fireflies
  - tree.py             : trees and shadows

Notes
- Requires an OpenGL-capable environment; some platforms may need a separate FreeGLUT install.
- If on-screen text rendering fails, console output still shows controls and time changes.
